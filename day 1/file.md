Introduction to Data types


In javascript there are different types of datatypes.

1)primitive data types
-String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null, and Symbol.

a)string
-A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

exmple:- `We can also create a string using a backtick`
        'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages'
        'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string'  

b)Number
Exmple:- Integers 0,9,-1,8
         Float 0.8,8.9 etc

c)Booleans
A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.

Exmple:-
          true // if the light is on, the value is true
          false // if the light is off, the value is false
